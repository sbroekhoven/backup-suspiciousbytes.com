			 <p>This project started as a simple experiment: could I build a small Python service that captures screenshots of websites, including .onion sites via a Tor proxy?</p>
<p>The result is a minimal Flask API that wraps headless Chrome using Selenium. It supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshotting regular or Tor-based websites</li>
<li>Optional proxy and viewport control</li>
<li>Basic API key authentication (not production ready)</li>
<li>Some metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a Docker-based deployment, with Caddy reverse proxy.</p>
<p>For OSINT and CTI use cases, this kind of tool can be useful to document phishing pages, defacements, dark web storefronts, or any site you want to capture quickly and securely without using a full browser.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not meant to be production-ready, but it works well as a proof of concept and as an idea for something more advanced.</p>

			 <p>Years ago‚Äîprobably around a decade‚ÄîI was managing email servers for a large number of domains. To make that work manageable and secure, I built some small tools to help me verify and monitor email domain configurations. One of those tools was <a href="https://github.com/sbroekhoven/check-maildomain">check-maildomain</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, it really saved me a lot of time and helped improve the security posture of the domains I managed. Fast forward to today, and surprisingly (or maybe not), many email systems are still not configured properly. Misconfigured or poorly secured mail domains continue to be a common problem and a risk.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I decided to dig up my old project, modernize it a bit, and bring it back to life. My hope is that this tool can again be helpful, not just for me, but for others trying to harden their email systems.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity has only become more critical over the years, and good email hygiene is an essential part of that. Once the first updated version is finished, I hope it can contribute to making the internet a bit safer, one mail domain at a time.</p>

			 <p>When running an external pentest, having a Kali machine on a different location than your (home) office can be helpful. When I do some testing, I regularly use a VM at Hetzner Cloud because of the descent speed and (per hour) pricing. üîê</p>
<p>Of course it‚Äôs possible to mount a Kali Linux ISO image, reboot your server and do a clean Kali Linux install, but that involves configuration, multiple reboots, partitioning and IPv6 address configurations problems.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is nice for a few times, but not every time, and it‚Äôs also hard to automate. So I did some experimenting with converting a Debian box, that spins up in seconds at Hetzner, to a Kali box.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-normal-user">Adding a normal user</h2>
<p>After the deployment, I always start with the creation of a <code>normal</code> user and add my public SSH key to its <code>authorized_keys</code> file so I don‚Äôt have to login with <code>root</code> every time.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After installation, reboot your machine and you will have a nice Kali box at your disposal.</p>
<h1 id="remote-desktop-support">Remote desktop support</h1>
<p>Sometimes a graphical interface on your Kali box can be helpful. No worries <code>XRDP</code> got that covered. The initial installation and configuration is quite easy.</p>
<p>The installation can also be found here:</p>

<p>[!info] Setting up RDP with Xfce | Kali Linux Documentation<br>
Kali Linux is supported on many different devices and systems. On some of those systems, you may only get a bare bones install and occasionally may not have direct access to a GUI such as with WSL. One simple way to get access to a GUI for Kali is by installing Xfce and setting up RDP.<br>

<p>From now on it‚Äôs possible to connect to your Kali Linux machine with the Remote Destop Connection app on your Windows computer. And because it‚Äôs just like RDP, other RDP clients should also work fine with this.</p>

<p>Create a snapshot at the Hetzner console when you have a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù Kali setup. With this snapshot it‚Äôs very easy to create a now machine that is exactly the same. Be aware that the cost of the diskspace of this snapshot will be added to your invoice,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to refresh the SSH host keys after creating a new machine from a snapshot with the following commands:</p>

<h2 id="disable-root-logins-with-ssh">Disable root logins with SSH</h2>
<p>Make sure you disable <code>root</code> to login with ssh directly.</p>

			 <p>Last weeks I&rsquo;ve started exercising at least twice a week and making some positive changes to my eating habits. As a result, I&rsquo;ve lost weight, feel healthier, experience less stress, and can concentrate better. üí™ü¶æü•ó</p>
<p>Why is this important for those of us in cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Working in cybersecurity often involves long hours, high-stress situations, and the need for sharp focus and quick decision-making. Regular exercise and healthy eating habits can significantly improve our physical and mental well-being, leading to:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚úÖ Enhanced focus and concentration: Physical activity boosts brain function and helps us stay alert and attentive.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Reduced stress levels: Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural stress relievers.</li>
<li>‚úÖImproved overall health: A balanced diet and regular exercise contribute to better physical health, reducing the risk of burnout and illness.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Increased energy levels: Staying active and eating well provide the energy needed to tackle demanding tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to my employer for supporting and sharing the importance of well-being. Their commitment to employee health makes a significant difference in our lives. üôå</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s prioritize our health to be at our best in both our personal and professional lives!</p>
